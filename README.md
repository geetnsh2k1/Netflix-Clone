## Brief Working

> The clone first introduces a real-time authentication system, the end-user can create his/her account on the web application and further for the next time can sign in to the application using the credentials. Google Firebase is used for the authentication system, it provides a real-time experience to the user. Now, after successfully sign in to the application, the user is redirected to the home page of the application. The home page comprises a list of trending movies of the week, action movies, crime movies, and much more, which are fetched from TMDB API. TMDB provides details about the movies and TV shows. The user can click on any of the movies provided on the application and can watch a trailer/short scene of the movie, and its overview.
